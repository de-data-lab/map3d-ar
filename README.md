# map3d-ar
Mapping application in 3D.

## Overview
This application maps point data as 3D towers with variable height, positioned across the state of Delaware.

Each tower represents a cluster of data points, and the height of the tower corresponds to the number of points.
In a typical 2D map with clustering, the greater the number of points within an area, the larger the circle,
but in this map, the greater the number of points, the taller the tower.

In this map, there are two datasets:
* Roadway intersections data from the DE Open Data Portal, as of August 2021 (<https://opendata.firstmap.delaware.gov/datasets/delaware::delaware-intersections-2-0/explore>)
* Vehicular crashes data from the DE Open Data Portal within 2022 (<https://data.delaware.gov/Transportation/Public-Crash-Data/827n-m6xc>)
